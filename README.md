# Exam Score Prediction-K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor (KNN)-Linear Regression

This project uses the Exam_Score_Prediction.csv dataset from Kaggle and compares two regression models: Linear Regression and KNN Regressor.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build predictive models that estimate students’ exam scores based on several academic and personal characteristics.

Two models were trained and compared using cross-validation to determine which one performs best in terms of prediction accuracy.

## Dataset Description

### Dataset: Exam_Score_Prediction.csv (Kaggle)

### Target Variable:exam_Score

### Features:age, gender, course, study_hours, class_attendance, internet_access,sleep_hours, sleep_quality, study_method, facility_rating, exam_difficulty


## Models Used
### Linear Regression

### K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor (KNN)

## Model Evaluation

Evaluation was performed using 10-fold cross-validation with the metric neg_mean_squared_error 


## Results :linear Regression performed better than KNN



## Conclusion:
Linear Regression provides better predictive accuracy for this dataset than KNN.

This suggests that the relationship between features and exam score is more linear than nonlinear, making Linear Regression a good fit.
